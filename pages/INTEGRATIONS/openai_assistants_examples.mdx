# Usage with the new OpenAI Assistants API

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";
import { Tabs, Tab } from "nextra/components";

## OpenAI Assistants integrated version



### Setting Up OpenAI

```python copy
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = '<openai_api_key>'

```



### Defining MultiOn Browser Function

Define the function to browse the web using natural language instructions. This function enables control over web browsers to fetch and interact with web content:

```python copy
browse = {
    "name": "highLevelBrowse",
    "description": "Browse the web using natural language instructions. This tool enables control over web browsers to fetch and interact with web content.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "instruction": {"type": "string", "description": "Detailed natural language instruction for browsing."},
            "url": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional starting URL for the browsing session."}
        },
        "required": ["instruction"]
    }
}
```




### Creating Assistant and Interaction

Define the function to interact with the assistant, including creating an assistant with the MultiOn Browse API, setting up a thread with the user's initial message, running the assistant on the thread, and retrieving the response:

```python copy
def agent(query: str):
    # Create an Assistant with the MultiOn Browse API
    assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
        instructions="You are an assistant with the capability to browse the web. Use the MultiOn browser to assist users in fetching and interacting with web content.",
        model="gpt-4-1106-preview",  # or another model of your choice
        tools=[{
            "type": "function",
            "function": browse
        }]
    )

    # Create a Thread with the initial user message
    thread = openai.Thread.create(
        assistant=assistant.id,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": query
        }]
    )

    # Run the Assistant on the Thread
    run = openai.Thread.runs.create(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        assistant_id=assistant.id
    )

    # Retrieve the response
    response = openai.Thread.messages.retrieve(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        message_id=run.messages[-1].id
    )

    return response.content
```



### Example Prompt and Agent Invocation

Define an example prompt and invoke the agent with the prompt to interact with the assistant:

```python copy
PROMPT = """
    You are an expert AI Agent whose job is to find and get a GPU on a given service HYPERSTACK (https://www.hyperstack.cloud). Pass in the full detailed instructions exactly as below to MultiOn for browsing.

        Here are the high-level steps:
        1. Login and go to reach the GPU selection page
        2. Click on the Load Provising profile and then select the MultiOn-profile and load it
        3. After the profile has been correctly selected and loaded continue
        4. If an on-demand A100 GPU is available with 80GB RAM, then reserve it
        5. If reservation is successful, then enable SSH access and return the public IP to access the machine
"""

# Invoke the agent with the prompt
agent(query=PROMPT)
```
