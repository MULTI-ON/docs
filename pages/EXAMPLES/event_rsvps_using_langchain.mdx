# Making event RSVPs using langchain ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

This example goes over how to leverage LangChain with Multion to rsvp to event invites automatically.

### Install Required Packages

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```python copy
pip install multion -U
pip install langchain
```

### Import Required Libraries

In your Python script, import the required libraries for the example:

```python copy
import multion
from multion import MultionToolSpec
from langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.tools.base import StructuredTool
```

### Initialize Multion and Log In

Initialize the Multion toolkit and log in to your Multion account:

```python copy
multion_toolkit = MultionToolSpec(use_api=True, mode="auto")
browser = StructuredTool.from_function(multion_toolkit.browse)

multion.login()
```

### Create OpenAI Language Model Instance

Create an instance of the OpenAI language model using API key

- Replace **"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"** with your actual OpenAI API key:

```python copy
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### Initialize Agent

Initialize the agent for structured chat with zero-shot reaction description:

```python copy
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[browser],
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Run the Agent

Run the agent with a user query. Update the query variable with your desired event link:

```python copy
EVENT = "https://lu.ma/11-16"

PROMPT = f"""
You are an AI Agent whose job is to RSVP users to event websites. Here is the event link: {EVENT}. DO NOT guess or make up any user information, instead ask user to provide any missing info. Do not use any placeholders. Pass in the full detailed instructions exactly as below to MultiOn for browsing.

Here are the high-level steps:
1. Register for the event
2. Skip sign in
3. Fill out the application form. DO NOT guess any information. Ask the user for any information you need.
4. After filling out the form, submit the application
5. Verify that the user is RSVP'd
"""

response = agent(query=PROMPT)
```
