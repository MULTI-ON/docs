# Get weather details using Multion-API âœ¨

This example goes over how to use multion API to get today's weather details. 

### Install Required Packages

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```python copy
  pip install multion
```

### Import Required Libraries

In your Python script, import the required libraries for the example:

```python copy
  import multion
```

### Log in to Multion

Log in to your Multion account with proper credentials:

```python copy
  multion.login()
```

### Set API Mode
Switch the API to local mode to run the Agent locally with the MultiOn Browser Extension for development and testing

(You can enable the remote mode to run on our hosted cloud for production use)

```python copy
  response = multion.set_remote(False)
```


### Create a New Session

Create a new session to initiate the weather query:

```python copy
  response = multion.create_session({"url": "https://www.google.com"})
  print(response['message'])
  session_id = response['session_id']
  session_id
```

### Update Session

If needed, update the session with additional information:

```python copy
  response = multion.step_session(session_id, {"input": "what is the weather today","url": "https://www.google.com"})
  response['message']
```


### Capture Screenshot

Capture a screenshot of the weather details:

```python copy
  multion.get_screenshot(response, height=800)
```

### Close Session

Finally, close the session when done:

```python copy
  multion.close_session(session_id)
```
