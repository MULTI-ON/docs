# Welcome to MultiOn AI

<Logo height={200} />

MultiOn is the Next-Gen Personalized Web AI Agent 🚀. Unlock the next generation of web automation and build custom AI agents that can perform complex actions on the internet with just a few lines of code.

You can install our **MultiOn Web Client** to reimagine how you interact with the internet and try it.

_Instead of you going to the information or interacting with websites, we let the information come to you to fully automate web browsing experience_ 🤗

## Using MultiOn:

MultiOn works in two modes: **Step-by-step** and **Auto**.

- We recommend starting by using the **step-by-step** mode, as using MultiOn is like driving a race car 🏎️, and we want you to learn the controls before going full throttle!
- **Step-by-step** mode requires you to approve each next step & allows you to build trust with MultiOn and watch how it is working on different scenarios 🙂
